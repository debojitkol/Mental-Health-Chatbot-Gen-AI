      "The story of Lord Ram is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "* He was exiled to the forest for 14 years by his stepmother, Queen Kaikeyi, who wanted her own son, Bharata, to become the king.\n",
      "* During his exile, Lord Ram's wife, Sita, was abducted by the demon king Ravana, who took her to his kingdom in Lanka (present-day Sri Lanka).\n",
      "* Lord Ram, along with his brother Lakshmana and the monkey god Hanuman, embarked on a journey to rescue Sita and defeat Ravana.\n",
      "* After a long and arduous battle, Lord Ram defeated Ravana and rescued Sita, returning to Ayodhya to reclaim his throne.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Ram is revered for his many virtues, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* His unwavering commitment to duty (dharma) and righteousness (satya)\n",
      "* His unshakeable loyalty to his family and friends\n",
      "* His bravery and strength in the face of adversity\n",
      "* His compassion and kindness towards all living beings\n",
      "\n",
      "In Hinduism, Lord Ram is often worshipped as a symbol of ideal manhood and is considered a role model for men. His story has been retold and reinterpreted in many different ways throughout Indian history and culture, and continues to be an important part of Hindu tradition and folklore.\n",

It's a complex condition that can be caused by a combination of factors, including biological, psychological, and environmental influences.\n",
      "\n",

I can also provide you with information about therapy, support groups, and other resources that may be helpful.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "It might be helpful to acknowledge that your feelings are valid and that it's okay to not be okay right now. Allow yourself to process your emotions, and don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or a trusted adult for support. Talking to someone about how you're feeling can be really helpful in navigating this difficult time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that grief, like the kind you might be experiencing after a breakup, is a natural part of the human experience. It's not something that needs to be \"fixed\" or \"medicalized,\" but rather something that you can work through with time, support, and self-care.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you feel comfortable, can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on and how you're feeling? Sometimes sharing your thoughts and emotions with someone who cares can help you feel heard and understood. I'm here to listen and offer support in any way I can.\n",
